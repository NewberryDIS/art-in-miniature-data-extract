# art-in-miniature-data-extract

This script is meant to extract metadata for the Newberry's Art in Miniature (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/newberry/art-in-miniature) crowdsourcing project, hosted on Zooniverse.

The script is based on examples present in Zooniverse's data-digging code repository (https://github.com/zooniverse/Data-digging) for extracting data from other Zooniverse projects.
